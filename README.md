# Bangalore House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the code and resources for the Bangalore House Price Prediction model, which is deployed using Flask and can be accessed at [https://house-price-predictor-f5vn.onrender.com](https://house-price-predictor-f5vn.onrender.com/).

The house price prediction model is built using machine learning techniques and is trained on a dataset of Bangalore house prices. It takes various input features such as the area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc., and predicts the corresponding price of the house.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the house price prediction model can be found at [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data).

Please note that the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the provided link and use it for training your own model or further analysis.

## Model Architecture and Implementation

The model is implemented using Python and leverages popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and decision tree, have been used to build the house price prediction model. Each algorithm offers its own strengths and limitations, and the model compares their performance to determine the best prediction results.

The following are the main steps involved in building and deploying the model:

1. **Data Collection**: A dataset containing Bangalore house prices is collected. This dataset consists of various features such as the area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc., along with the corresponding house prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and transform categorical variables into numerical representations. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training the machine learning models.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features may be derived or selected from the existing dataset to improve the predictive power of the models. Feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding, dimensionality reduction, or polynomial feature generation may be applied.

4. **Model Training**: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, KNN, AdaBoost, and decision tree, are trained on the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the input features and house prices.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated on the testing data to assess their performance. Evaluation metrics such as R2 score and Accuracy scores are calculated to measure the models' accuracy and predictive power.

6. **Model Selection**: The model with the best performance is selected based on the evaluation metrics. This model is saved and used for deployment.

7. **Model Deployment**: The selected trained model is deployed using the Flask web framework. Flask allows us to create a web application that can accept input from users, pass it to the model for prediction, and display the predicted house price on the website.
